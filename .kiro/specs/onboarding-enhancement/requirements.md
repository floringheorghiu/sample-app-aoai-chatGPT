# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves enhancing the existing onboarding flow for the NGO AI Assistant application to provide a more intuitive, engaging, and user-friendly experience. The current onboarding has two steps (persona selection and interest selection), but the interest selection step needs significant improvements in visual design, user experience, and functionality to better guide users through choosing their areas of interest.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user completing onboarding, I want a visually appealing and intuitive interest selection interface, so that I can easily understand and choose the topics that matter most to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I reach the interest selection step THEN I SHALL see a clean, well-organized interface with clear visual hierarchy
2. WHEN I view the interest topics THEN each topic SHALL be presented with clear descriptions and example questions
3. IF I hover over or interact with a topic THEN I SHALL receive immediate visual feedback indicating the interactive element
4. WHEN I select a topic THEN the selection SHALL be clearly indicated with appropriate visual styling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user browsing interest topics, I want to see clear topic labels that help me understand the different areas of assistance available, so that I can choose the most relevant topic for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the interest topics THEN each topic SHALL have a clear, descriptive label
2. WHEN I read a topic label THEN it SHALL clearly communicate what kind of assistance is available in that area
3. IF I select a topic THEN it SHALL be visually indicated as selected
4. WHEN I choose a topic THEN the quick questions for that topic SHALL be available later in the chat interface

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user who wants to explore the application, I want a clear way to skip detailed topic selection, so that I can start using the assistant immediately without being forced through lengthy onboarding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm on the interest selection step THEN I SHALL see a clear option to skip and explore on my own
2. WHEN I choose to skip topic selection THEN I SHALL be taken directly to the main chat interface
3. IF I skip topic selection THEN I SHALL still have access to all features and topics within the chat
4. WHEN I skip onboarding THEN my persona selection SHALL still be preserved for personalized responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the onboarding interface to be fully accessible, so that I can complete the process regardless of my abilities or assistive technology use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate the interface with keyboard only THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible and properly focused
2. WHEN I use screen reader technology THEN all content SHALL be properly announced with appropriate labels
3. IF I have visual impairments THEN the interface SHALL maintain sufficient color contrast and support screen magnification
4. WHEN I interact with any element THEN focus indicators SHALL be clearly visible and properly managed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on different devices, I want the onboarding experience to work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, so that I can complete onboarding regardless of my device choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access onboarding on mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL be fully responsive and touch-friendly
2. WHEN I use the interface on different screen sizes THEN all content SHALL remain readable and interactive elements appropriately sized
3. IF I rotate my device THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately to the new orientation
4. WHEN I interact with touch gestures THEN they SHALL work consistently across different mobile devices

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user progressing through onboarding, I want clear navigation controls, so that I can go back to previous steps if I want to change my selections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm on the interest selection step THEN I SHALL see a clear back button to return to persona selection
2. WHEN I click the back button THEN I SHALL return to the previous step with my previous selection preserved
3. IF I navigate backwards THEN I SHALL be able to change my persona selection and see updated interest topics accordingly
4. WHEN I navigate between steps THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and my progress SHALL be clearly indicated

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user completing onboarding, I want my persona and topic selections to create a personalized context for the AI assistant, so that it understands who I am and what I'm interested in from the start of our conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete onboarding THEN my persona and topic selections SHALL be used to generate a warm-up prompt for the OpenAI service
2. WHEN I start chatting THEN the AI assistant SHALL have context about my persona type and specific interest area
3. IF I selected a specific topic THEN the AI SHALL be informed that I'm interested in that particular problem area
4. WHEN the AI responds THEN it SHALL provide contextually relevant responses based on my persona and topic selection
