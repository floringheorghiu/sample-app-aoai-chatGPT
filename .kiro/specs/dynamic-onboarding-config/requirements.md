# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the admin dashboard's onboarding configuration editor to dynamically control the frontend onboarding flow. Currently, the frontend uses hardcoded configuration files for personas, topics, and quick questions. This feature will create a bridge between the admin-configured JSON and the frontend onboarding system, allowing real-time updates without code deployments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to configure onboarding personas, topics, and questions through the admin dashboard, so that the frontend onboarding flow reflects my customizations immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin updates the onboarding configuration in the admin dashboard THEN the frontend onboarding flow SHALL use the updated configuration within 30 seconds
2. WHEN the admin adds a new persona THEN the frontend persona selection SHALL display the new persona with proper theming
3. WHEN the admin modifies topic labels or quick questions THEN the frontend interest selection SHALL reflect these changes
4. WHEN the admin removes a persona or topic THEN the frontend SHALL gracefully handle the removal without breaking the flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a frontend user, I want the onboarding experience to reflect the latest admin configurations, so that I see current and relevant content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start the onboarding flow THEN the system SHALL fetch the latest configuration from the admin dashboard
2. WHEN the configuration is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to hardcoded defaults without breaking
3. WHEN I select a persona THEN the topics SHALL match the admin-configured topics for that persona
4. WHEN I select a topic THEN the quick questions SHALL match the admin-configured questions for that topic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the configuration synchronization to be reliable and performant, so that users have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend requests configuration THEN the response time SHALL be under 500ms
2. WHEN the admin configuration service is unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL use cached configuration
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate the structure before applying
4. WHEN invalid configuration is detected THEN the system SHALL log errors and use fallback configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the configuration system to be backwards compatible, so that existing functionality continues to work during migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dynamic configuration is disabled THEN the system SHALL use the existing hardcoded configuration
2. WHEN persona keys change THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing user data
3. WHEN the configuration API is not available THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully
4. WHEN migrating from static to dynamic config THEN existing user sessions SHALL not be disrupted

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the onboarding flow to handle configuration errors gracefully, so that I can always complete the onboarding process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration loading fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly message
2. WHEN a persona is missing from configuration THEN the system SHALL show available personas
3. WHEN topics are missing for a persona THEN the system SHALL provide default topics
4. WHEN quick questions are missing THEN the system SHALL provide default questions
