# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates a working multilingual RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline into the existing admin dashboard document upload functionality. The integration will replace the current mocked document processing with a real multilingual pipeline that can process documents in any language, translate them to English when needed, chunk them appropriately, generate embeddings, and index them in Azure Cognitive Search for RAG queries.

The system must securely handle Azure service credentials, support the existing UI workflow, and provide real-time processing feedback to administrators.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multilingual Document Processing Pipeline Integration

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to upload documents in any language and have them automatically processed through a multilingual RAG pipeline, so that the content becomes searchable and usable by the AI assistant regardless of the original language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator clicks "Rulează Procesarea" THEN the system SHALL execute the real multilingual RAG pipeline instead of the mocked process
2. WHEN documents are in Romanian or other non-English languages THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the language and translate content to English using Azure Translator
3. WHEN documents are processed THEN the system SHALL chunk them using the existing data_utils.py functionality with configurable chunk sizes
4. WHEN chunks are created THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings using Azure OpenAI embedding models
5. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL index all processed content in Azure Cognitive Search for RAG retrieval

### Requirement 2: Secure Credential Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Azure service credentials to be stored securely and not exposed in the codebase, so that the system maintains security best practices and credentials don't leak into public repositories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load Azure credentials from secure environment variables or configuration files
2. WHEN credentials are stored THEN they SHALL NOT be committed to version control or exposed in logs
3. WHEN the multilingual pipeline runs THEN it SHALL authenticate with Azure services using the securely stored credentials
4. WHEN configuration files contain credentials THEN they SHALL be added to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits
5. IF credentials are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages without exposing credential values

### Requirement 3: Real-time Processing Status and Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see real-time progress updates when documents are being processed through the multilingual pipeline, so that I can monitor the processing status and identify any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN document processing starts THEN the system SHALL create a job with unique identifier and initial status
2. WHEN processing progresses THEN the system SHALL update job status with detailed progress information including current stage and percentage complete
3. WHEN language detection occurs THEN the system SHALL report detected languages in the progress updates
4. WHEN translation happens THEN the system SHALL report translation progress and target language
5. WHEN chunking and embedding generation occurs THEN the system SHALL report the number of chunks created and embedding progress
6. WHEN indexing happens THEN the system SHALL report indexing progress and final document count
7. IF errors occur during processing THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information and display it to the administrator
8. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of processed documents, chunks created, and indexing results

### Requirement 4: Pipeline Configuration and Flexibility

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure the multilingual RAG pipeline parameters such as chunk size, overlap, and processing options, so that I can optimize the pipeline for different types of documents and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL load pipeline configuration from a secure configuration file
2. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL use configurable parameters for chunk size, token overlap, and embedding models
3. WHEN translation is needed THEN the system SHALL use configurable Azure Translator settings and target language preferences
4. WHEN indexing occurs THEN the system SHALL use configurable Azure Search index settings and field mappings
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL validate settings and provide clear error messages

### Requirement 5: Integration with Existing Admin Dashboard Workflow

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the multilingual RAG integration to work seamlessly with the existing document upload interface, so that I can continue using the familiar workflow without learning new processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN the existing upload UI SHALL continue to function without changes
2. WHEN "Rulează Procesarea" is clicked THEN the system SHALL trigger the real multilingual pipeline instead of the mock process
3. WHEN processing runs THEN the existing job status dialog SHALL display real progress information from the multilingual pipeline
4. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL update the UI with success/failure status as before
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display error messages in the existing error handling UI components
6. WHEN job cancellation is requested THEN the system SHALL attempt to cancel the running multilingual pipeline process

### Requirement 6: Document Format Support and Validation

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the multilingual pipeline to support the same document formats as the current system while providing robust error handling for unsupported or corrupted files, so that document processing is reliable and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are processed THEN the system SHALL support PDF, DOCX, TXT, and DOC formats as currently supported
2. WHEN unsupported file formats are encountered THEN the system SHALL skip them and report the unsupported format in the progress updates
3. WHEN file processing errors occur THEN the system SHALL continue processing other files and report specific error details
4. WHEN PDF files are processed THEN the system SHALL use Azure Form Recognizer for text extraction with layout preservation
5. WHEN text extraction fails THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative extraction methods and report the issue

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability Considerations

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the multilingual pipeline to process documents efficiently and handle multiple files without overwhelming system resources, so that the admin dashboard remains responsive during processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple documents are processed THEN the system SHALL process them in parallel with configurable concurrency limits
2. WHEN large documents are processed THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without causing memory issues
3. WHEN processing runs THEN the system SHALL not block the admin dashboard UI or other system operations
4. WHEN Azure service rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN processing takes a long time THEN the system SHALL provide regular progress updates to prevent timeout issues
