# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the NGO AI Assistant project from a manual local development and deployment workflow to a modern CI/CD-driven process. The transition will establish a GitHub-based source control system with automated Azure App Service deployment, improving version control, traceability, and deployment reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fork and clone the Microsoft sample-app-aoai-chatGPT template to my personal GitHub account, so that I can own and manage the full codebase independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I fork the Microsoft template repository THEN I SHALL have a personal GitHub repository with full ownership and control
2. WHEN I clone the forked repository locally THEN I SHALL have a local development environment that matches the GitHub source
3. IF the original template has updates THEN I SHALL be able to sync changes from the upstream repository when needed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish a CI/CD pipeline between my GitHub fork and Azure App Service, so that code changes are automatically deployed without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I push commits to the main branch of my GitHub fork THEN Azure App Service SHALL automatically trigger a deployment
2. WHEN the CI/CD pipeline runs THEN it SHALL build and deploy the application successfully
3. IF a deployment fails THEN I SHALL receive clear error messages and logs to troubleshoot issues
4. WHEN a deployment completes successfully THEN the updated application SHALL be live on Azure App Service

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to synchronize my local environment variables with Azure App Service configuration, so that my local development environment matches the production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure environment variables locally THEN they SHALL match the Azure App Service application settings
2. WHEN I test locally THEN the application SHALL behave identically to the deployed version
3. IF environment variables are missing or misconfigured THEN I SHALL receive clear error messages during local testing
4. WHEN I update environment variables THEN I SHALL be able to sync them between local and Azure environments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate existing custom code and configurations from my current project to the new GitHub-based workflow, so that I don't lose any previous development work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I migrate existing code THEN all custom features and modifications SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN I migrate configuration files THEN all settings SHALL be properly transferred to the new structure
3. IF there are conflicts between existing code and the template THEN I SHALL resolve them systematically
4. WHEN migration is complete THEN the application SHALL function with all previous capabilities intact

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish proper version control practices with the new workflow, so that I can track changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make code changes THEN I SHALL commit them with descriptive messages
2. WHEN I push changes THEN they SHALL be properly tracked in GitHub with full history
3. IF I need to revert changes THEN I SHALL be able to use Git version control features
4. WHEN working on features THEN I SHALL be able to use branching strategies for organized development

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that the new CI/CD workflow is working correctly, so that I can confidently use it for ongoing development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make a test change and push it THEN the CI/CD pipeline SHALL deploy it successfully
2. WHEN I verify the deployment THEN the change SHALL be visible in the live application
3. IF there are deployment issues THEN I SHALL be able to troubleshoot using Azure logs and GitHub Actions
4. WHEN the workflow is validated THEN I SHALL have confidence in the automated deployment process
