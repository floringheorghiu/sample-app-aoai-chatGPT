# Admin Dashboard Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for refactoring and integrating the existing admin-fe dashboard with the document processing capabilities from the scripts folder. The goal is to create a standalone Next.js application that can run on localhost and provide a functional interface for document management and system configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Standalone Next.js Application Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a standalone Next.js application so that I can run the admin dashboard locally without dependencies on external frameworks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `npm run dev` THEN the application SHALL start on localhost:3000
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL display the admin dashboard with proper styling
3. WHEN I navigate between tabs THEN the interface SHALL remain responsive and functional
4. IF dependencies are missing THEN the application SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 2: Document Processing Integration

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to upload documents and trigger processing so that I can manage the knowledge base content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload PDF, DOCX, or TXT files THEN the system SHALL accept and store them temporarily
2. WHEN I click "Run Ingestion" THEN the system SHALL execute the data_preparation.py script
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL show success/failure status
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL display detailed error messages
5. IF no Azure credentials are configured THEN the system SHALL run in mock mode

### Requirement 3: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage system prompts and onboarding configurations so that I can customize the AI assistant behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I edit the system prompt THEN changes SHALL be saved to a local configuration file
2. WHEN I modify onboarding questions THEN the configuration SHALL be validated and saved
3. WHEN I reload the page THEN previously saved configurations SHALL be restored
4. IF configuration files don't exist THEN the system SHALL create them with default values

### Requirement 4: Local File System Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the admin dashboard to work with local file storage so that it can operate without external APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN they SHALL be stored in a local `uploads` directory
2. WHEN configurations are saved THEN they SHALL be written to local JSON files
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL read existing configurations from local files
4. IF local directories don't exist THEN the system SHALL create them automatically

### Requirement 5: Script Execution Interface

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to execute document processing scripts through the web interface so that I can manage the ingestion pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I trigger ingestion THEN the system SHALL execute Python scripts with proper parameters
2. WHEN scripts are running THEN the interface SHALL show progress indicators
3. WHEN scripts complete THEN the system SHALL display execution results
4. IF Python environment is not configured THEN the system SHALL provide setup instructions

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged to both console and file
2. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
3. WHEN file operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with user feedback
4. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain basic functionality

### Requirement 7: Development Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear setup instructions so that I can quickly get the admin dashboard running locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I follow the setup instructions THEN the application SHALL run without additional configuration
2. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN all required packages SHALL be available
3. WHEN the development server starts THEN hot reloading SHALL work properly
4. IF setup fails THEN clear troubleshooting steps SHALL be provided
