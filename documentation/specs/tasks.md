  - Ensure variables match local .env.local file values
  - Test that Azure App Service can access all configured services
  - Verify no sensitive information is exposed in logs
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 6. Test initial CI/CD deployment
  - Make a small test change to the application
  - Commit and push the change to main branch
  - Monitor GitHub Actions workflow execution
  - Verify successful deployment to Azure App Service
  - Test deployed application functionality
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 6.1, 6.2_

- [ ] 7. Migrate existing custom code and features
  - Identify custom components from current NGO Assistant project
  - Integrate custom UI components into the forked template
  - Migrate custom API endpoints and backend logic
  - Resolve any conflicts between custom code and template structure
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 8. Update project configuration files
  - Modify package.json with custom dependencies and scripts
  - Update next.config.js with any custom configuration
  - Ensure .gitignore includes appropriate files (.env.local, .kiro/, etc.)
  - Update README.md with new development workflow instructions
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.4_

- [ ] 9. Implement error handling and logging
  - Add error handling for missing environment variables
  - Implement logging for deployment and runtime issues
  - Create health check endpoint for deployment verification

- [ ] 10. Create comprehensive tests
  - Write unit tests for custom components and functions
  - Create integration tests for API endpoints
  - Add environment validation tests
  - Implement smoke tests for post-deployment verification
  - _Requirements: 6.3_

- [ ] 11. Validate complete workflow
  - Test full development cycle: code change → commit → push → deploy
  - Verify all custom features work correctly in deployed application
  - Test error scenarios and recovery procedures
  - Confirm environment variable synchronization between local and Azure
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.4_

- [ ] 12. Document new development workflow
  - Create developer guide for the new CI/CD process
  - Document troubleshooting procedures for common issues
  - Update project README with deployment and development instructions
  - Create runbook for managing environment variables and deployments
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 13. Set up monitoring and alerts
  - Configure Application Insights for the deployed application
  - Set up alerts for deployment failures and application errors
  - Create dashboard for monitoring application health and performance
  - Implement logging for tracking user interactions and system events
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 6.3_

- [ ] 14. Implement branching strategy and additional environments
  - Create develop branch for integration testing
  - Set up staging environment with separate Azure App Service
