# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves modernizing the existing React-based frontend (FEv1) by incorporating the superior design patterns, UI components, and user experience elements from the Next.js-based frontend-v2 (FEv2). The goal is to evolve FEv1 while preserving its working Azure backend integration and deployment pipeline, using FEv2 as comprehensive design guidance rather than direct integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from FluentUI to a modern component library (Radix + Tailwind), so that I can achieve the polished design aesthetic demonstrated in FEv2.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I replace FluentUI components THEN the application SHALL use Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS styling
2. WHEN I implement the new design system THEN it SHALL match FEv2's visual design and color palette
3. IF existing functionality breaks during migration THEN I SHALL preserve all current features while updating the UI
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL maintain all existing Azure backend integrations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive onboarding flow with persona selection, so that I can have a personalized experience based on my role (Student/Parent/Teacher/Incognito).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I first visit the application THEN I SHALL see an onboarding flow that matches FEv2's design
2. WHEN I select a persona THEN the interface SHALL adapt with appropriate theming and context
3. IF I want to change my persona THEN I SHALL be able to do so through the interface
4. WHEN I complete onboarding THEN my persona selection SHALL persist across sessions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want an enhanced chat interface with improved message styling and layout, so that I can have a more engaging conversation experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send messages THEN they SHALL display with FEv2's improved styling and layout
2. WHEN I receive responses THEN they SHALL show with proper formatting, citations, and visual hierarchy
3. IF messages contain citations THEN they SHALL display in an organized citation panel like FEv2
4. WHEN I interact with the chat THEN the interface SHALL be responsive and accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive conversation history management, so that I can easily navigate and manage my previous conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access conversation history THEN I SHALL see a panel matching FEv2's design and functionality
2. WHEN I select a previous conversation THEN it SHALL load with full context and message history
3. IF I want to delete or organize conversations THEN I SHALL have appropriate management options
4. WHEN I create new conversations THEN they SHALL be properly tracked and stored

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want an enhanced feedback system, so that I can provide detailed feedback on AI responses and help improve the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to provide feedback THEN I SHALL see FEv2's comprehensive feedback interface
2. WHEN I submit feedback THEN it SHALL be properly categorized and stored
3. IF I want to rate responses THEN I SHALL have multiple feedback options (thumbs up/down, detailed categories)
4. WHEN feedback is submitted THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing backend feedback system

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want full Romanian localization throughout the interface, so that I can use the application in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the application THEN all interface text SHALL be in Romanian
2. WHEN I interact with any component THEN labels, buttons, and messages SHALL display in Romanian
3. IF there are dynamic messages THEN they SHALL be properly localized
4. WHEN I switch between features THEN the Romanian localization SHALL be consistent throughout

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve all existing Azure backend integrations, so that the modernized frontend continues to work with the current infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I update frontend components THEN all API calls to Azure services SHALL continue to function
2. WHEN I implement new UI features THEN they SHALL integrate with existing authentication and security
3. IF I modify state management THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with current backend responses
4. WHEN the modernization is complete THEN the deployment pipeline SHALL work without changes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved mobile responsiveness and accessibility, so that I can use the application effectively on any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the application on mobile devices THEN it SHALL display with FEv2's responsive design
2. WHEN I use assistive technologies THEN the interface SHALL be fully accessible
3. IF I resize the browser window THEN the layout SHALL adapt appropriately
4. WHEN I navigate with keyboard only THEN all functionality SHALL remain accessible
