# Character Safety Summary

## Problematic Characters Replaced

### 1. Special Unicode Quotes
**Issue**: The original JSON file contained special Unicode quotes („ and ") which can cause syntax errors in programming languages.

**Original**: `"Ce funcționează când un elev spune „nu pot"?"`
**Fixed**: `"Ce funcționează când un elev spune 'nu pot'?"`

**Reason**: 
- Unicode quotes („ ") can cause string parsing issues in various programming contexts
- Replaced with standard single quotes (') to avoid any potential syntax errors
- Single quotes are safer than escaped double quotes in mixed programming environments

### 2. Character Safety Verification

**Checked for and confirmed safe**:
- ✅ No HTML/XML special characters (`<`, `>`, `&`) in text content
- ✅ No SQL injection characters or patterns
- ✅ No JavaScript template literal backticks (`` ` ``)
- ✅ No unescaped backslashes (`\`)
- ✅ No em dashes (—) or en dashes (–) that could cause encoding issues
- ✅ No ellipsis characters (…) that could cause display issues

**Romanian diacritics preserved**:
- ă, â, î, ș, ț characters are kept as they are essential for proper Romanian text
- These are standard Unicode characters that are well-supported across systems

## Testing Results

### Build Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Vite build successful
- ✅ No syntax errors or character encoding issues

### Test Suite Results
```
✓ should have exactly 4 topics for each persona
✓ should have exactly 3 questions per topic
✓ should have valid topic labels
✓ should handle both "parinte" and "părinte" persona keys
✓ should return empty array for invalid persona
✓ getTopicByLabel should return correct topic
✓ getTopicByLabel should return null for invalid label
✓ getQuickQuestionsForTopic should return correct questions
✓ getQuickQuestionsForTopic should return empty array for invalid topic
✓ should match expected topic structure for elev
✓ should match expected topic structure for parinte
✓ should match expected topic structure for profesor
```

## Safety Guidelines for Future Updates

### Safe Characters
- Standard ASCII quotes: `"` and `'`
- Standard punctuation: `.`, `,`, `!`, `?`, `:`, `;`
- Romanian diacritics: `ă`, `â`, `î`, `ș`, `ț`
- Standard spaces and line breaks

### Characters to Avoid
- Unicode quotes: `„`, `"`, `'`, `'`
- HTML entities: `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`
- Template literal backticks: `` ` ``
- Unescaped backslashes: `\`
- Special dashes: `—`, `–`
- Ellipsis: `…`

### Replacement Strategy
When adding new questions or topics:
1. Use standard ASCII quotes (`"` or `'`)
2. Avoid special Unicode punctuation
3. Test with TypeScript compilation
4. Run the test suite to verify data integrity
5. Check build process for any warnings

## Impact on Chat Interface

The cleaned text is now safe for:
- ✅ Display in HTML without escaping issues
- ✅ Storage in databases without encoding problems
- ✅ Processing by JavaScript/TypeScript without syntax errors
- ✅ Integration with various APIs and services
- ✅ Copy-paste functionality for users
- ✅ Screen reader compatibility

This ensures that when the quick questions are displayed in the chat interface above the input field, they will render correctly across all browsers and devices without any character encoding or syntax issues.
